### SMartyModeling

SMartyModeling is an environment for Software Product Line (SPL) modeling, with support to most UML stereotype-based approaches.

SPL has proven to be the methodology for developing a diversity of software products and software-intensive systems at lower costs, in shorter time, and with higher quality. SPL development comprises a set of activities, such as, variability management, which is a key issue for the success of SPLs.

To provide support to the solution space in SPL and to solve interoperability problems mentioned earlier, we developed SMartyModeling, an environment to support SPLs, with support to UML stereotype-based approaches. The main benefit of SMartyModeling is the reuse of structures, including architectural views, requirements, and descriptions gathered from most existing used SPL tools as we built it as an instance of the VMTools-RA reference architecture for software variability tools.

#### Run
To run SMartyModeling, you need use Java 8 (<https://www.java.com/pt_BR/download/faq/java8.xml>):
